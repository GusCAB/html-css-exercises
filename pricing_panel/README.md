## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS  
- Flexbox
- CSS 
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This exercise helped me to better understand how Flexbox works and how it can be used to create interesting layouts by "nesting" them.

### Continued development

I still need to improve my ability to edit margins and paddings accordig to what is proposed by the design layout image.
In this project I edited the paddings of each page element idividually. Although it worked, I can see that in a larger project this aproach might lead to a hard to read/edit stylesheet.
